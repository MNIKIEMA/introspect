#  ðŸ”¬ Defog Introspect: Deep Research for your internal data

Introspect is a service that does data-focused deep research for structured data. It understands your structured data (databases or CSV/Excel files), unstructured data (PDFs), and can query the web to get additional context.

## Project Structure

- **`/backend`**: FastAPI Python server that handles AI processing, database connections, and API endpoints
- **`/frontend`**: Next.js web application providing the user interface
- **`/nginx`**: Configuration files for the web server

## Quick Start

1. Set up environment variables:

```bash
# Create a .env file in your root folder

GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
```

2. Start all services using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
