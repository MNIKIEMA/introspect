This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Motivation
This contains the self-hosted agents front-end that we will create for our enterprise users. It will help them:

1. Access our service from their own system
2. Let admin users add and manage general users
3. Let admin users connect to a data warehouse and add tables
